# TROMPA selectable-score React component

![Screenshot demonstrating selectable score](selectable-score.png)

This repository contains the selectable-score React component, a wrapper around a [MELD score component](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-clients-core) that allows for selection of score elements via click-and-drag, built using the [DragSelect](https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/DragSelect) node module. 

The MELD score is itself a wrapper around the [Verovio](https://verovio.org) MEI engraver supporting the incorporation of Linked Data (e.g. Web Annotations). 

This component is intended to serve various score-centric applications of the [TROMPA project](https://trompamusic.eu).

## Usage

To use the component in your project:

`import SelectableScore from 'selectable-score/dist/selectable-score';`

If your application requires paging through the score, additionally import the following:

```
import NextPageButton from 'selectable-score/dist/next-page-button';
import PrevPageButton from 'selectable-score/dist/prev-page-button';
```

### SelectableScore props
The `<SelectableScore>` component accepts the following props:

* `vrvOptions` (*optional*): a JSON object containing layout options to pass on to Verovio. [More information on Verovio options here](https://verovio.org/javascript.xhtml). If not specified, uses these defaults:

```
{ 
  scale: 45,
  adjustPageHeight: 1,
  pageHeight: 2500,
  pageWidth: 2200,
  footer: "none",
  unit: 6
}
```

* `selectionString` (*optional*): specifies the CSS selector used by DragSelect for click-and-drag selections. Any valid CSS selector acceptable; if not specified, defaults to `.note`.

* `onSelectionChange` (*required*): a callback to your application's selection handler. 

### NextPageButton and PrevPageButton props
The `<NextPageButton>` and `<PrevPageButton>` components are simple interaction wrappers that attach a click handler for MELD-score-based paging to any HTML (JSX) elements you care to provide -- typically, "Next page" and "Previous page" buttons. They accept the following props: 
  
* `buttonContent` (*optional*): Your JSX content for the button. This could be as simple as `<span>Next page</span>`. Note that you can attach your own click handlers if your application requires actions beyond the page turn itself to occur on button click -- but don't stop the click event's propagation (event.stopPropagation), or the page won't turn. Failure to supply buttonContent will result in an empty component. 

* `uri` (*required*): Your MEI file's URI. 

## Demo application

This repository also contains a minimal example React application integrating the selectable-score component. To run it, clone this repository, then:
```
cd selectable-score
npm install
npm start
```

Now point your web browser at https://localhost:8080. Wait a few moments for Verovio to render the score. 

Click and drag to select MEI elements (in this example, notes); hold down shift or ctrl to select discontinuous regions.

## Known issues

Paging is currently very slow. We're working on improving this, through MELD optimisations and potentially by running Verovio as a Web Worker (work in progress!)
